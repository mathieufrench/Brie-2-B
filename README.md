#💡 Introducing Retina Digital Dairy – the UK’s first AI-powered cheese-to-code automation platform. 🧀➡️💻 #

Tired of dealing with outdated, crumbly systems? Need to cut the bloat without making a mess? My new platform offers:

🔹 Brie-based automation – smooth workflows, zero friction
🔹 Cheddar-driven efficiency – because time is money
🔹 GoudaScript™ refactoring – transforming old, hole-ridden PHP into something grate

It’s time to modernize your tech stack, one wedge at a time. DM me if you want to be part of the future (or if you just appreciate a good Stilton pun).

Most importantly - this is an April Fools. Sorry.
